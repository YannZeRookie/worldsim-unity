# worldsim-unity

Unity integration of WorldSim.

Important: this uses the [WorldSim Engine](https://github.com/YannZeRookie/worldsim-engine) that will have to be git-cloned in another directory and copied/updated in this project using a special script. Sorry, no automated sub-modules for now. Down the road, a Unity package will be developed.
